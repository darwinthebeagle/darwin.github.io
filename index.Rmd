### I have a webpage!

And I can put all kinds of stuff on it!

### Add some links

I like [to read reddit](https://www.reddit.com).

More about me [about page](about.html).

I am learning to make [maps](maps.html) with GIS.

# MOOOOOOOOOOO

This is html for inputing a picture

That’s it!

Moving forward, make edits to your website by editing your .Rmd files or _site.yml and then rebuilding your site in RStudio (which will update the .html files). Then push these changes from your local directory to GitHub so they are reflected online.

Tips for building websites
The important stuff on your website is the content – what you say, how clearly you say it, and how easy it is for a reader to find the information they care about. Keeping things up-to-date is critical, and can require frequent tweaking (of e.g. your resume or list of projects).

Default website themes (which come from Bootswatch) are pretty good. You can modify these if you want; speaking from experience, you can also fall down a rabbit hole and spend a few days learning CSS to make stylistic changes that seem critical but that, in fact, no one will ever notice. That’s probably not a good use of your time, and you will eventually get tired of any styling you do anyway. Instead, add a default theme to your YAML and change it from time to time.

The best way to extend your website is to copy from other websites you like. You can borrow structurally (e.g. how content is organized) or specific elements (e.g. how that person added a twitter button). People generally understand that this happens (and make their code public to help!), but if you borrow a lot it’s friendly to shoot the person an email to say their stuff was useful.

Websites about projects
As noted, the preceding example is about a personal website but illustrates useful ideas. If you’re making a website about a data science project, I recommend including:

A landing page giving a broad overview of the project
A page (or pages) about the data wrangling, including the raw data if appropriate
Separate pages for each distinct analysis, possibly organized using menus
R and package versions used in the analyses

Problem 1
Create a personal website at <YOUR_GH_NAME>.github.io (or some other reasonably-named location). This page can be as extensive as you’d like, but it should include at least:

A brief introductory landing page
A page giving your academic and professional experience (i.e. a resume)
Links in the site navigation for your GitHub account, your email, and any other professional networks.
Problem 2
Create a flexdashboard using plotly for that includes at least three distinct plot types (e.g. scatterplots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, etc.). Use one of the following datasets, and load from the p8105.datasets package:

Instacart
NY NOAA
NYC Restaurant Inspections
These datasets are large; you may want / need to filter or randomly sample from the complete dataset to ensure a reasonable product.
